# FCAI-CU_CSS112_A2
This repository is used to test and learn Git and GitHub basics as a part of the Structured Programming course's second assignment provided by [FCAI Cairo University](https://fcai.cu.edu.eg/).

This repository contains a simple [Conncet Four Game](CS112_A1_T6_20230432.py) using python.

The game board is made of 7 columns and 6 rows displayed each turn.

Players play with a chip, either `X` or `O` for simplicity. In their turn, they drop the chip from top of the board, _by choosing a column number_, until it settles in the bottom empty cell.

The objective of the game is to be the first to form a `horizontal`, `vertical`, or `diagonal` line of four of one's own chips.
